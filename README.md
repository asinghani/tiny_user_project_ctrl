# tiny_user_project_ctrl

Control a `tiny_user_project` via the serial port from a Python script.

This is done by configuring the Caravel's I/O cells such that the Caravel CPU can control the inputs/outputs of the user project without any additional wiring or components. The same method can be used without the serial port, by directly running test code on the Caravel CPU core.
